"""Turn a base-vs-patched property-test differential into one evidence item.

Emits to stdout a single object matching
remediation.schema.json#/$defs/patch_evidence (kind: property).

The verdict rests on one asymmetry, which is the whole reason a property test
is evidence about a *fix* rather than just a good test:

    base FAILS, patched PASSES  -> proves
    base FAILS, patched FAILS   -> fails_to_prove   (fix incomplete)
    base PASSES                 -> fails_to_prove   (property does not
                                                     witness this finding)

That last case is the one people get wrong. A property that already held
before the patch may be perfectly true and perfectly useless here: it tells
you nothing about whether this fix closed anything. Reporting it as proof
would be the exact overclaim the evidence contract exists to prevent.

pytest exit codes (documented in pytest's own `ExitCode` enum) distinguish
"tests ran and failed" from "nothing ran":

    0 passed | 1 failed | 2 interrupted | 3 internal error
    4 usage error | 5 no tests collected

Only 0 and 1 are verdict-bearing. Everything else means the differential did
not happen, and is reported as `not_attempted` rather than guessed at.
