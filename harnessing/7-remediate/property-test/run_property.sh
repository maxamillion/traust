#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run a property test against the UNPATCHED and PATCHED revisions and emit one
# evidence item matching remediation.schema.json#/$defs/patch_evidence
# (kind: property).
#
# The evidence is the asymmetry, not the pass: a property that fails on the
# base revision and passes on the patched one witnesses the finding and now
# guards it. A property that passes on both may be a fine test but says
# nothing about this fix. property_evidence.py holds that logic.
#
# Containment (S9/S10). Both runs execute the target's test suite, which is
# hostile-input execution, so this inherits run_checks.sh's boundary:
# rootless, cap-dropped, no-new-privileges, credential-free, digest-pinned
# image, --network=none for the test runs. Dependencies are fetched in a
# separate networked, script-less step (pip --no-deps on a pinned version,
# rule S7) exactly as run_checks.sh prefetches. No native fallback: without
# podman there is no boundary and therefore no evidence.
#
# Neither run touches the caller's worktree. Both are disposable copies —
# the patched one as-is, the base one reset to <base-ref> with the property
# test injected, because the test does not exist at that revision.
#
# Usage:
#   run_property.sh <worktree> <base-ref> <test-path> [<out-dir>] [<timeout-s>]
#
# <test-path> is relative to the worktree root.
# Output (stdout): one JSON object (a patch_evidence item).
