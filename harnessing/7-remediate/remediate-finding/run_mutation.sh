# Mutation-test the package a patch touched and emit ONE evidence item
# matching remediation.schema.json#/$defs/patch_evidence (kind: mutation).
#
# Why this exists: a regression test that passes proves the test RUNS, not
# that it would FAIL if the fix were reverted. A mutant that survives on the
# patched line is direct evidence the added test asserts nothing.
#
# Containment (S10). mewt runs the target's own test suite once per mutant,
# so it is hostile-input execution and inherits run_checks.sh's boundary
# exactly: rootless, cap-dropped, no-new-privileges, credential-free,
# --network=none, digest-pinned image, and a disposable copy rather than the
# caller's worktree (so no .git of the real checkout is reachable at all).
# The mode is a deployment setting (`sandbox:` in
# $TRAUST_CONFIG_HOME/execution-boundaries.yaml), defaulting to `none`. A
# configured `podman` mode is never silently downgraded: with no working
# runtime the script emits `not_attempted` instead. Either way the campaign
# runs on a disposable copy with a scrubbed environment — run_checks.sh
# records that PATH shims alone are "not a boundary", and a mutation campaign
# executes target code N times rather than once.
#
# Scope: Go only. mewt supports C++, DAML, Go, JS/TS, Rust, Solidity and Move
# but NOT Python, so mutation evidence is never portfolio-wide assurance.
# Widening means granting that toolchain in the safe-exec profile first.
#
# NEVER RUNS ON THE REMEDIATION WORKTREE. mewt rewrites target files in place
# and stores state in a `mewt.sqlite` in its working directory; upstream's own
# docs advise running "against a clean git repo so that you can use
# `git reset --hard HEAD` to restore any mutations that escape the cleanup
# phase" (docs/how-it-works.md). The remediation worktree is exactly where the
# patch diff comes from, so a leaked mutation or a stray database would
# corrupt the artifact under review. This script therefore copies the
# worktree, mutates the copy, and deletes it.
#
# Cost: a campaign is targets x mutants x test-suite-duration and can run for
# HOURS. Point it at the package the patch touched, never a repository root,
# and note the hard timeout below.
#
# Usage:
#   run_mutation.sh <worktree> <target-path> [<out-dir>] [<timeout-seconds>]
#
# Output (stdout): one JSON object (a patch_evidence item).

# --- execution boundary (config, not environment) ----------------------------
# How target build/test code runs is a deployment decision, read once from
# $TRAUST_CONFIG_HOME/execution-boundaries.yaml:
#
#   none    (default) run directly — scrubbed env, disposable copy
#   podman  nested rootless container, --network=none, digest-pinned image
#
# `podman` is not silently downgraded: if the mode asks for a container and no
# working runtime exists, the lane reports `not_attempted`, because quietly
# weakening the boundary someone configured is worse than producing no
# evidence. Detection is `podman info` rather than `command -v podman` — the
# client binary exists on a host whose VM is stopped and in images that ship
# the CLI with no runtime.
#
# The resolved mode is recorded in the emitted evidence.
