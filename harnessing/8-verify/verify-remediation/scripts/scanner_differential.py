"""Compare a scanner's facts across two revisions and emit typed evidence.

This is the executable half of stage 8. `/verify-remediation` is otherwise a
targeted re-audit: it reads the original and patched code and reasons about
them, but executes nothing, which is why `docs/disposition-ledger.md` §8a caps
its evidence at "analysis, not execution". Re-running the backing scanner on
both revisions is cheap, deterministic, and lifts that cap for the one claim
it can actually support: *the pattern that evidenced this finding no longer
fires.*

Emits one object matching
remediation.schema.json#/$defs/patch_evidence (kind: scanner_differential),
carried on a verification report's `evidence[]` (contracts >= 0.4.0).

What the verdict means, and the limit that comes with it:

    fires on base, gone on patched  -> proves
    fires on both                   -> fails_to_prove
    does not fire on base           -> not_attempted

`proves` here is deliberately the weakest of the `proves` results. §8a's
wording is the authority: a cleared fact is not a correct fix — a diff can
silence a scanner by moving the sink. What this establishes is that the
*evidence the finding rested on* is gone, which is a real and checkable
claim, and nothing more.

The third row matters. If the rule does not fire on the unpatched revision
there is no differential to observe: either the finding was not
scanner-backed, or the rule pack has moved since the audit. Saying
`not_attempted` is honest; calling it `proves` because the patched scan is
clean would credit the patch for a fact that was never there.

Inputs are two adapter result files as written by
`python3 -m traust.cli adapters opengrep|checkov` — `report["facts"]`, each
fact carrying `rule_id`, `file`, `start_line` (traust_engine.adapters).
